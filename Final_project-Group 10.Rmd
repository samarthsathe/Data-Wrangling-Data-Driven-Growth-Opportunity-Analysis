## Introduction

<center> ![](C:\Users\samar\OneDrive\Desktop\Regork.jpg) </center>
  

<p align="justify">   
In this analysis, we aim to address a critical business problem concerning the disparities in total sales value among different age groups within the Regork customer base. The significance of this issue lies in the potential for substantial revenue growth that can be unlocked by tapping into currently underperforming customer segments. The Regork CEO should be keenly interested in this analysis as it directly impacts the company's bottom line and growth prospects.
</p>
  
**Methodology and Data:**
<p align="justify"> 
To tackle this problem, we leveraged a combination of: 
  
* campaigns: campaigns received by each household
* campaign_descriptions: campaign metadata (length of time active)
* coupons: coupon metadata (UPC code, campaign, etc.)
* coupon_redemptions: coupon redemptions (household, day, UPC code, campaign)
* demographics: household demographic data (age, income, family size, etc.)
products
* transaction<-get_transaction(): To get the full transactions data set. Contains transaction-level product purchases by households.
* promotions<-get_promotions(): To get the full promotions data set. Contains product placement information corresponding to campaigns.
</p>

  
<p align="justify">   
We integrated these diverse data sources using common identifiers like household IDs, UPC codes, and campaign affiliations. This integration allowed us to establish meaningful relationships among the datasets. Data wrangling involved preprocessing and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step included handling missing values, transforming data types, and aggregating information when necessary. EDA was conducted to gain insights into the data. We explored the distribution of sales, the effectiveness of different campaigns, and the influence of promotions on customer behavior.
</p>

  
**Proposed Solution:**
<p align="justify">  
Our analysis will provide the Regork CEO with a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the observed differences in total sales across various age groups. We will identify potential growth opportunities by delving into customer behavior, product preferences, and marketing effectiveness. By the end of this analysis, we aim to propose data-driven strategies that can help boost sales in underperforming age groups, such as 19-24, 25-34, 55-64, and 65+. These strategies may include targeted marketing campaigns, product bundling, or promotional offers, all designed to engage and capture the market share of these age groups. Ultimately, our goal is to empower the Regork CEO with actionable insights that can drive revenue growth and ensure a more balanced distribution of sales across different customer segments.

## Packages Required

<h4>The following R packages are required in order to run the code in this R project:</h4>
  

```{r}
library(completejourney)          # grocery store shopping transactions data from group of 2,469 households
library(ggplot2)                  # data visualization plotting system using "Grammar of Graphics"
library(knitr)                    # dynamic report generation in R
library(tidyverse)                # tidying data and working with other R packages
library(dplyr)                    # manipulating and transforming data (i.e., filtering, joining, etc.)
library(viridis)                  # provides a set of color palettes for data visualization.
```

<h4> Get the complete Journey Transaction and Promotions Dataset</h4>
```{r}
#Due to the size of the transactions and promotions data, the package provides a sampling of the data built-in with transactions_sample and promotions_sample. However, you can access the full promotions and transactions data sets from the source GitHub repository with the following:
transactions<- get_transactions()
promotions <- get_promotions()
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
    
<p align="justify">
In this phase of our analysis, we delve into the data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the total sales by age group. The primary objective is to identify age groups that exhibit lower sales figures, signifying potential growth opportunities.

Our EDA process involves examining the sales distribution across various age groups within our customer base. We aim to pinpoint specific age demographics that contribute less to the total sales revenue. By doing so, we can highlight potential segments where targeted strategies and interventions may lead to increased engagement and higher sales.
</p>

<h4> Analysis of Total Sales by Age Group </h4>
```{r include=TRUE}
filtered_data <- demographics %>%
  inner_join(transactions, by = "household_id") %>%
  filter(age %in% c("19-24","25-34", "55-64", "65+", "45-54", "35-44")) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(sales_value)) %>%
  arrange(age, desc(total))

highest_sales <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarize(total = max(total))


ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = age, y = total)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge",fill="lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Total Sales Comparison by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Total Sales($)") +
  theme_minimal()+
    geom_text(data = highest_sales, aes(label = total), vjust = -0.5, color = "black")
```

From the grouped bar plot, it is evident that the total sales vary across different age groups. Notably, the age groups '45-54' and '35-44' consistently exhibit significantly higher sales compared to the other age groups, which include '19-24,' '25-34', '55-64,' and '65+'. These two age groups, '45-54' and '35-44,' stand out as key contributors to the overall sales revenue, suggesting that they represent lucrative market segments with substantial purchasing power. The same is evident by the sales trent graph as well.

```{r}
color_palette <- c("#FF5733", "#FFD700", "#228B22", "#9400D3", "#00BFFF", "#8A2BE2")
line_styles <- c("solid", "dashed", "dotdash", "longdash", "dotted", "twodash")

sales_data <- transactions %>%
  inner_join(demographics) %>%
  filter(age %in% c("25-34", "19-24", "55-64", "65+", "45-54", "35-44"))

sales_summary <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(age, week) %>%
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales_value))

linetype_mapping <- data.frame(age = unique(sales_summary$age), linetype = line_styles)

ggplot(sales_summary, aes(x = week, y = total_sales, color = age, linetype = age, group = age)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = linetype_mapping$linetype) +
  labs(title = "Sales Trend by Age Group",
       x = "Week",
       y = "Total Sales($)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

  
To gain a deeper understanding of why some age groups might not be generating sales at the same level as '45-54' and '35-44', we need to explore additional factors.

<h4> Investigating Coupon Redemption and Campaign Participation </h4>
```{r include=TRUE}
age_groups_combined <- list(c("25-34", "19-24", "55-64", "65+"), c("45-54", "35-44"))
group_names <- c("25-34, 19-24, 55-64, 65+", "45-54, 35-44")

redemption_counts <- list()

for (i in 1:length(age_groups_combined)) {
  age_groups <- age_groups_combined[[i]]

```


For the age groups '25-34,' '19-24,' '55-64,' and '65+,' it is evident that both the coupon redemption rate and campaign participation are relatively low. These findings help explain why these age groups contribute to lower total sales compared to other groups. With lower coupon redemption rates and fewer campaign participations, there may be untapped potential to engage and incentivize these age groups more effectively to boost their total sales contributions. By focusing on these age groups and enhancing our promotional efforts, we can aim to tap into their market potential and drive higher sales. We will be conducting an analysis to identify the top 10 products most frequently purchased by the age groups '25-34,' '19-24,' '55-64,' and '65+'. This analysis is aimed at gaining insights that can be leveraged to enhance sales strategies and better cater to the preferences of these age groups, ultimately contributing to increased sales within these demographics.


<h3> Top 10 Products Analysis by Age Groups </h3>

We have conducted an analysis to identify the top 10 products purchased by specific age groups (19-24, 25-34, 55-64, and 65+). This information provides valuable insights into the preferences of these age groups and presents opportunities for increasing sales.

To leverage this data for sales growth, we can consider several strategies:

* Targeted Coupons: By offering coupons or discounts on the top 10 products within each age group, we can incentivize purchases and attract more customers to these items.

* Tailored Campaigns: Design marketing campaigns that highlight these top products, focusing on the age groups that purchase them the most. Personalized campaigns can engage customers and drive sales.

* Product Bundling: Identify complementary products that are often purchased together with these top products. For example, if a particular age group frequently buys cheese, consider bundling it with wine or other related products to encourage additional purchases.

* Product Placement: Optimize the placement of these products in stores or online platforms to enhance visibility and convenience for customers. Strategic placement can increase impulse purchases.

By implementing these strategies, we aim to not only increase sales of the top products within these age groups but also enhance the overall shopping experience for our customers. This data-driven approach allows us to tailor our marketing and promotional efforts to the specific preferences of each age group, ultimately driving growth in sales and customer satisfaction.

This analysis employed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to derive insights and hypotheses. Various datasets, including customer demographics, transaction history, product details, and campaign data, were used. The approach involved data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation to uncover patterns and trends.

**Age Group Preferences:** Different age groups exhibited distinct preferences for product categories. For example, '19-24' and '25-34' showed interest in SNACKS, while '55-64' favored FLUID MILK PRODUCTS.

**Campaign Participation:** Certain age groups, such as '25-34,' had lower campaign participation, indicating potential areas for improvement.

**Sales Trends:** '45-54' and '35-44' consistently demonstrated higher sales, suggesting their significance in revenue generation.

**Implications to the Consumer:** Regork should consider implementing targeted strategies to increase campaign participation and sales for specific age groups. For instance, personalized email campaigns, online contests, and tailored marketing communication can engage younger audiences ('19-24' and '25-34'). Bundled offers combining preferred and less-purchased products can incentivize buying among older age groups ('55-64' and '65+').
